## Hi. I'm a junior/middle developer. I graduated from the Leningrad Electrotechnical University in the direction of "Information Systems and technologies". At the university, I did a lot of projects in various programming languages. I programmed both the front and the back. Now I am actively studying python and I think to develop in this direction.
